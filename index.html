                <h1>Tech-savvy from a young age</h1>
                <p>As a technology enthusiast from a young age and growing up with it always around me, I have always had a keen interest in various technological aspects, from building applications and games to tinkering with the internet of things (IoT) projects. I have always been driven to the challenge of first understanding the goal, learning new aspects of technology, and then adapting it to the task at hand. I am passionate about building practical technology projects that help make a difference in the world; I love learning new things and sharing that where I can. I love gaming and seeing how each element of the code works with each other, seeing if it is possible to find a glitch, bug or exploit and contacting the developers about it so they can try and fix it—helping the community grow and be more inclusive to everyone. The person that got me interested in IT (Information Technology) would be my father, known as Developersteve (also legal middle name). He taught me some of the skills I use today.</p>

                <h1>Why I chose RMIT</h1>
                <p>I chose the prestigious RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) because it is a fantastic technology university and has a reputation for being one of the best universities in Australia. Ranked 59th globally, RMIT offers exactly what I am looking for. Extensive and excellent online classes, great student help and tutoring, plus all the people who graduated from RMIT, E.G. Leigh Bowery, Toni Matičevski, Andrew Stockdale, Albert Ernest Kitson, Lydia Lassila, Gillian Chung, James Wan, and many more. It has been a significant confidence boost to know that a prestigious university like RMIT has accepted me and is giving me a chance to show my worth and allow me to grow and evolve my skills. To quote, "There is no secret to success. It results from preparation, challenging work, and learning from failure" -General Colin Powell.</p>

                <h1>What do I expect to learn</h1>
                <p>I expect to learn basic IT (Information Technology) skills like Cyber security, data analysis, cloud computing, machine learning, fundamental programming (JavaScript, Python, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), swift), system and networks, ETC. In addition, I want to learn about website building, how to work effectively within a development team, how to use the GitHub repository and pages, managing infrastructure, writing, and managing a scalable codebase and application delivery. I primarily hope to work and build upon the skills I have already learned and learn new skills that can be useful now and during my future career. In addition, I want to learn how to create and evolve my ideas and expand my interests in IT (Information Technology). I also want to help others with their skills and help them grow so we can all grow and help each other so the technology industry can grow and evolve.

                <p>Attain the skills, qualifications and experience needed for the Ubisoft 3C's Gameplay Programmer role. I will continue attending RMIT to obtain a bachelor's degree in programming and IT. In conjunction with furthering my studies, I will look to gain industry experience by building out my projects and ideas. I hope to also obtain more knowledge by securing part-time work as a junior game developer or junior developer. I aim to get into an established company and continue to hone my skills to be promoted by proving my capabilities as a developer. My (current) ultimate goal is to secure a position in Ubisoft as a 3C's Gameplay Programmer. It will take a while but will be worth it, though plans change, so it may not be my ultimate goal job forever, and that is perfectly fine.</p>
