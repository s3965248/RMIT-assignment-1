                <h1>Tech-savvy from a young age</h1>
                <p>As a technology enthusiast from a young age and growing up with it always around me, I have always had a keen interest in various technological aspects, from building applications and games to tinkering with the internet of things (IoT) projects. I have always been driven to the challenge of first understanding the goal, learning new aspects of technology, and then adapting it to the task at hand. I am passionate about building practical technology projects that help make a difference in the world; I love learning new things and sharing that where I can. I love gaming and seeing how each element of the code works with each other, seeing if it is possible to find a glitch, bug or exploit and contacting the developers about it so they can try and fix it—helping the community grow and be more inclusive to everyone. The person that got me interested in IT (Information Technology) would be my father, known as Developersteve (also legal middle name). He taught me some of the skills I use today.</p>

                <h1>Why I chose RMIT</h1>
                <p>I chose the prestigious RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) because it is a fantastic technology university and has a reputation for being one of the best universities in Australia. Ranked 59th globally, RMIT offers exactly what I am looking for. Extensive and excellent online classes, great student help and tutoring, plus all the people who graduated from RMIT, E.G. Leigh Bowery, Toni Matičevski, Andrew Stockdale, Albert Ernest Kitson, Lydia Lassila, Gillian Chung, James Wan, and many more. It has been a significant confidence boost to know that a prestigious university like RMIT has accepted me and is giving me a chance to show my worth and allow me to grow and evolve my skills. To quote, "There is no secret to success. It results from preparation, challenging work, and learning from failure" -General Colin Powell.</p>

                <h1>What do I expect to learn</h1>
                <p>I expect to learn basic IT (Information Technology) skills like Cyber security, data analysis, cloud computing, machine learning, fundamental programming (JavaScript, Python, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), swift), system and networks, ETC. In addition, I want to learn about website building, how to work effectively within a development team, how to use the GitHub repository and pages, managing infrastructure, writing, and managing a scalable codebase and application delivery. I primarily hope to work and build upon the skills I have already learned and learn new skills that can be useful now and during my future career. In addition, I want to learn how to create and evolve my ideas and expand my interests in IT (Information Technology). I also want to help others with their skills and help them grow so we can all grow and help each other so the technology industry can grow and evolve.

                <p>The test results mean that I am more logical than emotional, have great pride, and keep my word. I work best alone, and I work best hands-on, and I experiment with many different solutions to find the perfect solution for the task at hand. I do not like talking about what to do for too long and would instead just do it. Lengthy discussions make me lose patience quite quickly. My weaknesses are annoying, but it is manageable. The Big Five Personality Intellect/Imagination description does not match my identity, but the score does. I expected that the tests would not be exact because people are complex, with multiple layers of emotions; understanding is not that simple that you could guess someone within a few questions.</p>

                <p>These test results influence my behaviour in a team because I would instead work alone than in a group. I work better alone than in a team; if forced to work with others, I will take the job with the least amount of talking and working with others until we either have to hand it in or there is some drama. Then, I have to get involved to get everyone back on track (highly unlikely), or I finish what I am doing and have to help another person with their particular part of the assignment. If/when we have to discuss the project, I will put in what I think we should do/say/make and buckle down on it; I will be stubborn until everyone picks one, and then I will switch.</p>

                <p>How I should take this into account when I am forming a team is I should try to get people who are like my working style. These others would go off and do their own thing while we have one person with the easiest part of the assignment but make communication happen with the other group members. Also, try to get people who know what they have to do and one creative person to think up ideas and the design of what we are doing so that we do not spend a significant amount of time just trying to figure out how it is going to look. Also, I will need someone to do the speaking part of the assignment (if there is a part like that). Someone good at all the work details so they can finish quickly and see if anyone needs help with their aspect of the project.</p>

                <h1>Project Summary</h1>
                <p>My Project idea is a game where you play through the different eras of gaming, starting in 1958 and moving to the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. You will play one round/level/game and then move on to the next. After completing the 1990s game, you will fully start the game's plot. An antagonist is destroying the earlier rounds because they want to influence the history of games and make their favourite games the only games left. It is your job to defeat the antagonist and save all gaming history. Without the old game ever existing, the newer and future matches will not have any inspiration and game mechanics made by the old games, so they disappear.</p>

                <h1>Motivation</h1>
                <p>My motivation for designing this game is, I have never seen or heard of a game like this before. I believe people need to understand and respect retro and classic games, which helped shape the gaming industry and community into what it is today. I've always had a passion and love for retro games since I was young. Even now, some of my favourite games are old games (Kirby's adventure, Mario the lost levels, Tetris, ETC). Retro game developers did not have much to work with because it was still very new; there was not much regarding coding, game mechanics and visual design. However, these developers made many game mechanics still in use today. For example, the first-ever 'Boss' in videogames was developed in 1975 in a role-playing game called dnd on the PLATO system.</p>

                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>The game is about travelling through the years of gaming, starting in 1958, playing pong (the first game made). After beating the game (scoring 5 points), you move onto the 60s, playing Spacewar! (Win by defeating opponent) On the PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor 1), 70s Galaxian (win by destroying all the invading aliens), 80s Tetris (get to a score of 10,000) and 90s sonic the hedgehog (complete first level). I will change the games just enough that copyright does not take the game down (changing the characters and enemies so you can still see the retro-inspired nuances). Throughout the game, little glitches will happen (visual glitches, sprites not rendering correctly). Then once you beat the Sonic the Hedgehog level, a portal will open.</p>
                <p>The graphic will start to turn into code (matrix-like code), and sonic will turn into the player's basic form (the cursor on Windows/Mac/Linux) and walk through the portal, starting the main plot of the game, the antagonist (TBD) is destroying the old games one by one. The game developers are banding together to take the antagonist down and restore the fun with the help of the master code, a line of the first-ever written code (cout << "Hello World"), (it is that line of code because it's the first thing you write in C++). Players go and confront the antagonist with all the developers. There is a cut scene of talking with the antagonist about what they are doing is wrong and that we are here to stop them. The antagonist seems to have a change of heart and comes to have a peaceful talk. Still, it is a ploy to get the master code and wipe all the developers and protagonists out of existence. Still, the protagonist does not die, and the antagonist is stunned and retreats, fearing what the protagonist is. The protagonist wakes up in a creator where the game developers got wiped out of existence and has a moment of confusion and sadness before getting angry and wanting vengeance for the fallen comrades. The protagonist returns to the base the game developers had and gets ready for a fight with the antagonist, knowing that the antagonist has the master code and can use it to wipe the game out one by one. The protagonist sees a map leading to 4 artifacts (python-poison breath attack, HTML5-magic book with the different tags as magic spells, JavaScript- a roll dodge, java- an upgrade to the JavaScript roll dodge that make it a phase dodge that can go through enemies), weaker than the master code.</p>
                <p>Still, each has different abilities, so the protagonist goes and searches for the artifacts and collects them. When coming back can try the new skills on the enemies (antagonists army they created). Once the artifacts are collected, the protagonist goes to the castle the antagonist has built to defeat the antagonist. Going through the castle, the antagonist has four generals (TBD). The protagonist defeats the four generals to make it to the castle's throne room, where the antagonist is waiting and destroying games. When the protagonist walks into the throne room, the antagonist is destroying a green dinosaur with a shell on its back (Yoshi from Yoshi's island) and says for the protagonist to wait while I take care of this thing (referring to Yoshi). The protagonist gets angry and rushes the antagonist. The antagonist hits the protagonist away and says," OK, you want to fight so badly? Then let us fight!" The boss battle happens. After the boss battle and the antagonist loses, the protagonist picks up the master code to try and bring back the game developers but cannot because the protagonist is a player and cannot edit the code without a terminal. So, the player (protagonist) gets sad and angry and throws the master code, hitting a trapdoor under some rubble. The protagonist goes and searches the rumble for the trap door and opens it. Going inside the trapdoor, the protagonist sees a basement with an old Macintosh SE/30 with a singular white blinking line in the top left corner of the screen. The player also sees a coffee machine and a fold-out bed. The player makes a cup of coffee, sits at the table with the Macintosh SE/30, and says," let us get started fixing things", and you can hear typing happening as the player begins to remake all the deleted games, starting with pong. Blue code creates a pong paddle in the room and flies out the trapdoor. The credits roll.</p>

                <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
                <p>The software needed to make the game is called flutter. It is used to create apps and games for most devices, including but not limited to android phones, iPhone, Xiaomi phones, Linux, macOS and Windows. Hardware would be most devices since it is pixel 2d and is not 3d, which means it does not need as many graphics as those 3d games. It also has the potential to run on older consoles like the GBA (Game Boy Advanced), PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, ETC. Anything that can run 32-bits can run the game. I will also make any sprites, sprite sheets, images and backgrounds needed using an online pixel art maker like piskelapp.</p>

                <h1>Skills Required</h1>
                <p>Knowing one of three programming languages, C, C++, and Dart, requires skills. Also, an understanding of game programming fundamentals and visual design fundamentals, and knowledge of how to use flutter. It would not be difficult to obtain these skills. However, it will take time to learn the programming languages. Can do online courses to learn C, C++, and Dart. The visual design part of the project would be a bit difficult with the length of creating the Sprites, Sprite Sheets, Images and Backgrounds. And the programming part of the project will take the most time. While making multiple game mechanics, I may be able to reuse some of the lines of code from the individual game parts. For example, jumping from Sonic the Hedgehog into the main game, the collision of galaxian can be used to kill enemies in the central part of the game.</p>

The protagonist from the first game will switch roles and be the antagonist for the second game. The character will become mad with power, changing the games to suit their needs. Changing the timeline, the protagonist collects the same four artifacts from the first game and some new ones to try and defeat them; however, they fail to do so. Then, boom! Something happens to the antagonist. I won't reveal the entire plot before the game development, so stay tuned.</p>

                <h1>How should I take this into account when forming a team?</h1>
                <p>How I should take this into account when I am forming a team is I should try to get people who are like my working style. These others would go off and do their own thing while we have one person with the easiest part of the assignment but make communication happen with the other group members. Also, try to get people who know what they have to do and one creative person to think up ideas and the design of what we are doing so that we do not spend a significant amount of time just trying to figure out how it is going to look. Also, I will need someone to do the speaking part of the assignment (if there is a part like that). Someone good at all the work details so they can finish quickly and see if anyone needs help with their aspect of the project.</p>

                <h1>Project Summary</h1>
                <p>My Project idea is a game where you play through the different eras of gaming, starting in 1958 and moving to the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. You will play one round/level/game and then move on to the next. After completing the 1990s game, you will fully start the game's plot. An antagonist is destroying the earlier rounds because they want to influence the history of games and make their favourite games the only games left. It is your job to defeat the antagonist and save all gaming history. Without the old game ever existing, the newer and future matches will not have any inspiration and game mechanics made by the old games, so they disappear.</p>

                <h1>Motivation</h1>
                <p>My motivation for designing this game is, I have never seen or heard of a game like this before. I believe people need to understand and respect retro and classic games, which helped shape the gaming industry and community into what it is today. I've always had a passion and love for retro games since I was young. Even now, some of my favourite games are old games (Kirby's adventure, Mario the lost levels, Tetris, ETC). Retro game developers did not have much to work with because it was still very new; there was not much regarding coding, game mechanics and visual design. However, these developers made many game mechanics still in use today. For example, the first-ever 'Boss' in videogames was developed in 1975 in a role-playing game called dnd on the PLATO system.</p>

                <h1>Description</h1>
                <p>The game is about travelling through the years of gaming, starting in 1958, playing pong (the first game made). After beating the game (scoring 5 points), you move onto the 60s, playing Spacewar! (Win by defeating opponent) On the PDP-1 (Programmed Data Processor 1), 70s Galaxian (win by destroying all the invading aliens), 80s Tetris (get to a score of 10,000) and 90s sonic the hedgehog (complete first level). I will change the games just enough that copyright does not take the game down (changing the characters and enemies so you can still see the retro-inspired nuances). Throughout the game, little glitches will happen (visual glitches, sprites not rendering correctly). Then once you beat the Sonic the Hedgehog level, a portal will open.</p>
                <p>The graphic will start to turn into code (matrix-like code), and sonic will turn into the player's basic form (the cursor on Windows/Mac/Linux) and walk through the portal, starting the main plot of the game, the antagonist (TBD) is destroying the old games one by one. The game developers are banding together to take the antagonist down and restore the fun with the help of the master code, a line of the first-ever written code (cout << "Hello World"), (it is that line of code because it's the first thing you write in C++). Players go and confront the antagonist with all the developers. There is a cut scene of talking with the antagonist about what they are doing is wrong and that we are here to stop them. The antagonist seems to have a change of heart and comes to have a peaceful talk. Still, it is a ploy to get the master code and wipe all the developers and protagonists out of existence. Still, the protagonist does not die, and the antagonist is stunned and retreats, fearing what the protagonist is. The protagonist wakes up in a creator where the game developers got wiped out of existence and has a moment of confusion and sadness before getting angry and wanting vengeance for the fallen comrades. The protagonist returns to the base the game developers had and gets ready for a fight with the antagonist, knowing that the antagonist has the master code and can use it to wipe the game out one by one. The protagonist sees a map leading to 4 artifacts (python-poison breath attack, HTML5-magic book with the different tags as magic spells, JavaScript- a roll dodge, java- an upgrade to the JavaScript roll dodge that make it a phase dodge that can go through enemies), weaker than the master code.</p>
                <p>Still, each has different abilities, so the protagonist goes and searches for the artifacts and collects them. When coming back can try the new skills on the enemies (antagonists army they created). Once the artifacts are collected, the protagonist goes to the castle the antagonist has built to defeat the antagonist. Going through the castle, the antagonist has four generals (TBD). The protagonist defeats the four generals to make it to the castle's throne room, where the antagonist is waiting and destroying games. When the protagonist walks into the throne room, the antagonist is destroying a green dinosaur with a shell on its back (Yoshi from Yoshi's island) and says for the protagonist to wait while I take care of this thing (referring to Yoshi). The protagonist gets angry and rushes the antagonist. The antagonist hits the protagonist away and says," OK, you want to fight so badly? Then let us fight!" The boss battle happens. After the boss battle and the antagonist loses, the protagonist picks up the master code to try and bring back the game developers but cannot because the protagonist is a player and cannot edit the code without a terminal. So, the player (protagonist) gets sad and angry and throws the master code, hitting a trapdoor under some rubble. The protagonist goes and searches the rumble for the trap door and opens it. Going inside the trapdoor, the protagonist sees a basement with an old Macintosh SE/30 with a singular white blinking line in the top left corner of the screen. The player also sees a coffee machine and a fold-out bed. The player makes a cup of coffee, sits at the table with the Macintosh SE/30, and says," let us get started fixing things", and you can hear typing happening as the player begins to remake all the deleted games, starting with pong. Blue code creates a pong paddle in the room and flies out the trapdoor. The credits roll.</p>

                <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
                <p>The software needed to make the game is called flutter. It is used to create apps and games for most devices, including but not limited to android phones, iPhone, Xiaomi phones, Linux, macOS and Windows. Hardware would be most devices since it is pixel 2d and is not 3d, which means it does not need as many graphics as those 3d games. It also has the potential to run on older consoles like the GBA (Game Boy Advanced), PlayStation 1, PlayStation 2, ETC. Anything that can run 32-bits can run the game. I will also make any sprites, sprite sheets, images and backgrounds needed using an online pixel art maker like piskelapp.</p>

                <h1>Skills Required</h1>
                <p>Knowing one of three programming languages, C, C++, and Dart, requires skills. Also, an understanding of game programming fundamentals and visual design fundamentals, and knowledge of how to use flutter. It would not be difficult to obtain these skills. However, it will take time to learn the programming languages. Can do online courses to learn C, C++, and Dart. The visual design part of the project would be a bit difficult with the length of creating the Sprites, Sprite Sheets, Images and Backgrounds. And the programming part of the project will take the most time. While making multiple game mechanics, I may be able to reuse some of the lines of code from the individual game parts. For example, jumping from Sonic the Hedgehog into the main game, the collision of galaxian can be used to kill enemies in the central part of the game.</p>

                <h1>Outcome</h1>
                <p>My greatest hope for this game is that it's a hit and gets a lot of fans. Then, continuing from the momentum of this game's success, I'll develop a second game. The protagonist from the first game will switch roles and be the antagonist for the second game. The character will become mad with power, changing the games to suit their needs. Changing the timeline, the protagonist collects the same four artifacts from the first game and some new ones to try and defeat them; however, they fail to do so. Then, boom! Something happens to the antagonist. I won't reveal the entire plot before the game development, so stay tuned.</p>
